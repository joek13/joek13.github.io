## Favorite projects

### [WXTJ Playlist Converter](https://kerrigan.dev/wxtj-converter)
At the University of Virginia's student-run radio station [WXTJ](https:/www.wxtj.fm), DJs often spend time organizing their show playlists on music streaming services like Spotify.
I built this tool to automate the conversion of Spotify playlists to the station's `.csv` format. Since then, the application has also seen heavy use from hosts at [WTJU](https://www.wtju.net), WXTJ's sister station.
