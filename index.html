    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a student developer and Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
        I study computer science and mathematics in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and I'll be graduating in May 2023.
        Afterwards, I plan to start work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services in Seattle, WA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of my interests are functional programming, compilers, and systems programming.
        I'm always looking for applications of my mathematical interests (like abstract algebra) in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of software, I train with <a href="https://virginia.clubrunning.org/">UVA Club Running</a>
        and play bass in the <a href="https://music.virginia.edu/jazz-ensemble">UVA Jazz Ensemble</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use he/him/his pronouns.
