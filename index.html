    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">I'm a student developer and Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia.</p>
    <p>
        I study computer science and mathematics in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.
        Some of my interests are functional programming and cloud infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of software, I train with <a href="https://virginia.clubrunning.org/">UVA Club Running</a> and play bass in the <a href="https://music.virginia.edu/jazz-ensemble">UVA Jazz Ensemble</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use he/him/his pronouns.

            I'm solving the 2022 <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> alongside some of my friends.
            I'm writing my solutions in Haskell, but it's entirely possible I give up and switch to Python.
            See my progress (and find out if I chickened out) in <a href="https://github.com/joek13/advent-of-code-2022">this GitHub repository</a>.

            I accepted a job offer with Amazon Web Services.
            I plan to start work as a Software Development Engineer in their Seattle offices during summer 2023.
