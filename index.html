    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an incoming software engineer @ <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">AWS EC2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I was a <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/scholarship">Jefferson Scholar</a> at the University of Virginia,
        where I studied computer science and mathematics. Outside of class, I was an executive member of <a href="https://virginia.clubrunning.org/">UVA Club Running</a>,
        and I played bass in the <a href="https://music.virginia.edu/jazz-ensemble">UVA Jazz Ensemble.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of my interests are functional programming, compilers, and systems programming.
        I'm always looking for interesting applications of my mathematical interests (like abstract algebra) in computer science.
