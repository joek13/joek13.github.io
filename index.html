    <p class="subtitle">I'm a student developer and Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia.</p>
    <p>
        I study Computer Science and Mathematics in the College of Arts & Sciences. Some of my current interests are
        full-stack web development, cloud infrastructure, and functional programming. I am a passionate student of
        theory, but I am also a builder; as such, I am captivated most by elegant solutions to problems of practical
        importance. I am driven to leverage the incredible power of modern computing towards socially responsible
        ends.

    <h2>Experience</h2>

            href="https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship">Civic Digital Fellow</a> at United
        States Special Operations Command, where I built a deep learning based image inference pipeline, designed
        full-stack web applications, and managed cloud deployments on Kubernetes.

        I have also worked two summer internships with <a href="https://www.leadtools.com/">LEAD Technologies</a>,

        capabilities.
