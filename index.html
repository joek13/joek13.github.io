    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an incoming software engineer at Amazon Web Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I was a Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia.
        In May 2023, I graduated from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, where I studied computer science and mathematics.
        At UVA, I was an executive member of <a href="https://virginia.clubrunning.org/">UVA Club Running</a>,
        and I played bass in the <a href="https://music.virginia.edu/jazz-ensemble">UVA Jazz Ensemble</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of my interests are functional programming, compilers, and systems programming.
        I'm always looking for applications of my mathematical interests (like abstract algebra) in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use he/him/his pronouns.
