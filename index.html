    <p class="subtitle">I'm a student developer and Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia.</p>
    <p>
        I study computer science and mathematics in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.
        Some of my current interests are full-stack web development, cloud infrastructure, and functional programming.
        As a passionate student of theory, I'm fascinated by the formalisms underlying the state of the art.
        But I'm also a builder; as such, I am most captivated by elegant solutions to problems of practical importance.
        I am driven to harness the incredible power of modern computing towards socially responsible ends.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        My past experience includes working as a <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/summer-fellowships">Civic Digital Fellow</a>
        at United States Special Operations Command, where I built a deep learning based image inference pipeline, designed full-stack web applications,
        and managed cloud deployments on Kubernetes.

        I have also worked two summer internships with <a href="https://www.leadtools.com/">LEAD Technologies</a>,
        developing iPhone and Android applications that leverage LEADTOOLS image- and document-processing
        capabilities.
