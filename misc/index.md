# Miscellany

## Tools
- [WXTJ/WTJU playlist converter](https://www.kerrigan.dev/wxtj-converter/) &ndash;
  At the University of Virginia's student radio station [WXTJ](https://www.wxtj.fm/), DJs often plan their show using Spotify playlists.
  This tool automatically converts Spotify playlists to the format accepted by the station's web interface.

## School notes
Though I have come to prefer taking notes using pen and paper, I have published digital notes for a few classes at the University of Virginia.
These notes reflect the classes as I took them and might be incomplete.
