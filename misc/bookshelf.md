### Currently reading
*A Random Walk Down Wall Street* by Burton Malkiel

### Recent reading
- *The Second Coming* by Walker Percy
    - Didn't realize this was a sequel until I had finished it. *The Last Gentleman* is on my list to read soon.
- *The Chaneysville Incident* by David Bradley
    - Blurb on the back compares it to Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man*, so I impulse-bought. Can't recommend it enough.
- *Godel, Escher, Bach* by Douglas Hofstadter
    - Ok, I actually haven't finished this one yet. I needed a break.
